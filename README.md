# Image-Recognition-Waste-Management-System
This project involves buiding an image recognition system using CNN for integration into the waste management website to ensure proper identification of waste products.

```
The Waste Management website is an idea generated and created by a team of specialists, including data scientists, 
product designers, AI engineers, website designers, product owner, and scrum master to curb environmental abuse
with inclusion of poor waste disposal. This platform, named 'Eko WastEarN' has various features and they include:
Waste classification, Waste disposal, Recycling services and Community service. Decomposed or unidentifiable waste 
products can be identified by the use of the embedded waste classfication system, created with convolutional neural 
network algorithm. The most unique leverage of this website is the ability of individuals to dispose waste and earn by
way of a priorly calculated reward system.
```

Image Recognition System is designed to classify the images of waste products into plastic, plant, metal, wood, and food using CNN. This is essential in the waste management project because some wastes might have decomposed, giving room for no form of identification. 

> Convolutional neural network (CNN)is type of neural network model that usually used for computer vision tasks like image classification, object detection, image recognition, etc. It is the brain behind the current deep learning discoveries and improvements in technology.

### MODEL METHODOLOGY

1. Loading important libaries.
2. Load data on Dataloader and apply transformation.
3. Split data for training, validation, and testing.
4. Load these datasets on seperate dataloaders.
5. Apply label on each dataset and show the images.
6. Build the neural network's architecture model using relu activation function.
7. Specify loss function and optimizer.
8. Train and validate model.
9. Test model using the loaded test data.
